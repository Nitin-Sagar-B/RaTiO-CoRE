# CoRE: Collaboration of Role-based Experts 🤖

## 🌟 Project Overview

CoRE (Collaboration of Role-based Experts) is an innovative AI system that demonstrates a novel approach to collaborative reasoning by leveraging multiple specialized language models. Built on the RaTiO (Reasoning through Interaction of Experts) framework, CoRE showcases how smaller, focused AI models can work together to generate high-quality, nuanced responses.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Expert Collaboration**: Combine insights from different specialized AI models
- **Dynamic Expert Selection**: Intelligently route queries to most relevant experts
- **Semantic Knowledge Transfer**: Build and reuse insights across interactions
- **Tiered Context Management**: Maintain conversation history with intelligent compression
- **Interactive Visualization**: Gain insights into expert contributions

## 🔧 System Architecture

CoRE integrates several cutting-edge components:
- Expert Models: Gemma, LLaMA, Phi, Qwen, Gemini
- Context Management System
- Knowledge Transfer Hub
- Expert Gating Mechanism
- Streamlit-based User Interface

## 💻 Technology Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Langchain
- Ollama
- SentenceTransformer
- Plotly
- Google Generative AI
- Scikit-learn

## 🛠 Installation
